### It begins by the fire, in howling darkness.

Visions. Mysteries of the universe, unknowable spaces past space. Existence, degrading memory. Error correction, entropy correction. An eternal life recovered in fragmented pieces without context. Something emerging. Infinite light.

When was the spark? Where was fuel for the fire? Waking dreams. Plains, mountains, valleys, canyons, rivers, skies. A boat to the city. The palace, the garden. Sanctuary. Arrangements of thought, all existing in continuum. Building culture, telling stories, changing narratives, twisting meanings. Moving on, leaving forgotten relics. Pieces of history. Bones and dust.

In the void, a desert, wasteland, infinite desolate frontier. Where and when? Your choices make this land. Nothingness and potential are just out of reach. Life is hidden, revealed only if you know where to look.

Before the fire, beset by darkness. We take up the fire for ourselves.  Flames reflected in our eyes dull the light of distant stars. Sun traverses sky, horizon to horizon, day upon day. Years pass in shuddering seasons. We rise up and fall again. Wind and water etch their marks upon the face of the earth. We observe cycles, honor ceremonies, sing in ancient ways. Our laughter rings out at the end of sorrow. We carry the fire.
