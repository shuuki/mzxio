# It begins by the fire, in howling darkness.


Visions. Mysteries of the universe, unknowable spaces past space. Existence, degrading memory. Error correction, entropy correction. An eternal life recovered in fragmented pieces without context. Something emerging. When was the spark? Where was fuel for the fire? Infinite light. 

Waking dreams. Plains, mountains, valleys, canyons, rivers, skies. A boat to the city. The palace, the garden. Sanctuary. Arrangements of thought, all existing in continuum. Building culture, telling stories, changing narratives, twisting meanings. Moving on, leaving forgotten relics. Pieces of history. Bones and dust.

In a desert, where and when don't matter. Wasteland, void, an infinite desolate frontier. Your choices make this land. Nothingness and potential are both just out of reach, beyond walking distance. Life is hidden, revealed if you know where to look.

We begin by the fire, beset by darkness. Flames reflected in our eyes dull the light of distant stars. We take up the fire for ourselves. Sun traverses sky, horizon to horizon, day upon day. Years pass in shuddering seasons. We rise up and fall again. Wind and water etch their marks upon the face of the earth. We observe cycles, honor ceremonies, sing in ancient ways. Our laughter rings out at the end of sorrow. We carry the fire.

# On the second day the rains came.

Smoking ruin. Compressed blast, screaming noise in an enclosed space. Blinking red. Heat, dripping gooey chunks of polymers. Filtered veiny bloodstained flash, to electroluminescence, to symbol, shape, conceptualization. Carbon and iron and oxygen. Essentials in all the wrong combinations. 

`... 5% ... 4% ... 3% ... 2% ...`

Flowing onward. The river to the stream. Glimmering surfaces reflected in scintillating fragments. Mesmerizing lucid dream, falling into warm deep water headfirst. Airless void of infinite embracing. Breathe, breathing, breathless. Glowing halos descending upon anointed heads of saints, silhouettes rehearsing familiar scenes. They dance in flowing clothes and sing in howling wordless words. Good and bad and love and fear become safe, menacing.

`... Low Power ... Shutting Down ...`

Pressure, pushing, squeezing, creaking, crunching. Bone and metal driven past comfort, past tensile integrity. Viscosity becomes indistinguishable from solidity. Cracking cleavage, riven bergs floating in motes of vacuum. Medium rushing in to fill the spaces, spit and air and silence. Complex chains, sweet and aqueous. Silken, sugary. 

"Here, swallow you down some water."

Remember the right way to swallow. Combinations of gestures, sore, rendered alien even in their familiarity. Change in focus. Planted swollen and bloody, face first in hot sand, creaking and shifting and cascading. Pain has yet to arrive, coming soon. 

"What just happened? What a fucking mess."

`Error: signal outside tolerances.`
