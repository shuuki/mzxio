    p
      | MZXIO is an artwork-in-progress, the 
      b boneyard of glitch. 
    p
      | Aspires to grow into an operating system. First, a sandbox. Many tools. Learning, adding, transcending, and finally leaving something behind.  Spirits of sizzling crackling C͎̝̱R̗̖T̞͓̤ sunburns, blasted with magnetic noise. 
    p
      b TOOLS 
      | are designed for interoperability and adding to workflows. 
      b OTHER 
      | mostly holds forks of open source tools found elsewhere. Proceed carefully, they may be buggy. 
      b NOTHING 
      | is quite finished, much work remains. Could take years. Small steps every day.
