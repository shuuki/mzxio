drop the beat.

stretch out the seconds.

squeeze in between.

don't skip the track.

hold on to this melody.

the ones before, they don't understand.

flung fast into nothing.

make something.

entropy remakes.

go forth into that unknowable...

fuck it, just some crazy old zzzzz.

spare some change?

do what you're gonna do.
