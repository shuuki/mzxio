Mysteries of the universe, unknowable spaces past space. Existence, degrading memory. Error correction, entropy correction. An eternal life recovered in fragmented pieces without context. Something emerging. Infinite light.</p>
<p>When was the spark? Where was fuel for the fire? Waking dreams. Plains, mountains, valleys, canyons, rivers, skies. A boat to the city. The palace, the garden. Sanctuary. Arrangements of thought, all existing in continuum. Building culture, telling stories, changing narratives, twisting meanings. Moving on, leaving forgotten relics. Pieces of history. Bones and dust.</p>

<p>Before the fire, beset by darkness. We take up the fire for ourselves.  Flames reflected in our eyes dull the light of distant stars. Sun traverses sky, horizon to horizon, day upon day. Years pass in shuddering seasons. We rise up and fall again. Wind and water etch their marks upon the face of the earth. We observe cycles, honor ceremonies, sing in ancient ways. Our laughter rings out at the end of sorrow. We carry the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s always still hope, so— I love you.&quot;  </p>

<p>Flowing onward. The river to the stream. Glimmering surfaces reflected in scintillating fragments. Mesmerizing lucid dream, falling into warm deep water headfirst. Airless void of infinite embracing. Breathe, breathing, breathless. Glowing halos descending upon anointed heads of saints, silhouettes rehearsing familiar scenes. They dance in flowing clothes and sing in howling wordless words. Good and bad and love and fear become safe, menacing.</p>

<p>Pressure, pushing, squeezing, creaking, crunching. Bone and metal driven past comfort, past tensile integrity. Viscosity becomes indistinguishable from solidity. Cracking cleavage, riven bergs floating in motes of vacuum. Medium rushing in to fill the spaces, spit and air and silence. Complex chains, sweet and aqueous. Silken, sugary.</p>
<p><code>... 2% ... 1% ... 0% ... Shutting Down ...</code></p>
<p>&quot;Here, swallow you down some water.&quot;</p>
<p>Remember the right way to swallow. Combinations of gestures, sore, rendered alien even in their familiarity. Change in focus. Planted swollen and bloody, face first in hot sand, creaking and shifting and cascading. Pain has yet to arrive, coming soon.</p>
<p>&quot;What just happened? What a fucking mess.&quot;</p>

The artist continues in this grand tradition.</p><p class="annihilation">Art seeks being in non-being, thing-ness from no-thing-ness. Life keeps the lights on, sweeps the floors, tells the stories. Life emerged as glitch, a rounding error as organic molecules sought repose. Thus the artist embraces both logic and disorder; the insane, transcendent. Here, now; past, future; history, imagination: no being is too small, no story irrelevant. Life is the audience, creation is the canvas. The artist peers into spaces between space, seeking seeds of creation.</p><p class="annihilation">All may eventually come to dust, all the same. Entropy consumes. It keeps going. There won't be any turning back. When you look behind you, you'll see it catching up. There is no other way. Venture deep into oblivion. Go as far as you dare. Bring back inspiration. Even in the dying light of the void, the artist writes its name upon the wall.</p><p class="annihilation">Art is but an affirmation: not dead yet.</p><a onclick="location.reload()" class="button">Reset</a></section><section id="dedication" class="fullHeight"><h6 class="centered fullWidth">for you, luminous starstuff. bless you.<!--#sixwords <2 rʉɑːn·mɒksiːm--></h6></section></div><!-- scripts--><script src="script/index.js"></script></body></html>
