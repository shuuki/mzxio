You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep... Oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell. Me, I was part of the nastiness now.<cite>Raymond Chandler, The Big Sleep</cite></blockquote><blockquote>Fear no more the heat o’ the sun, Nor the furious winter’s rages; Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages: Golden lads and girls all must, As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.<cite>William Shakespeare, Cymbeline</cite></blockquote><script>//
