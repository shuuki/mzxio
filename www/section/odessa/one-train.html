<p>howling rushing through eternal night.</p>
<p>stink like shit and sweat.</p>
<p>so precious beautiful strangers.</p>
<p>howling darkness.</p>
<p>hold in stasis.</p>
<p>ruin fragments, flashes and taps.</p>
<p>sweet oblivion, stroking the screens.</p>

<p>who, what, where, why.</p>
<p>meaningless in interstices.</p>
<p>always with this space, always with the sore sorrowful locals.</p>
<p>the regulars.</p>
<p>out to the rotting fruit. fermenting routine.</p>
<p>sweet perfume of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>so precious.</p>
