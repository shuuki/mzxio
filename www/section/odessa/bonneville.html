<p>drying slick of salty tears.</p>
<p>tracks of desert on cheeks<br>never really ragged<br>forever soft.</p>
<p>we forget when we look from far away.</p>
<p><em>hard is tested by soft</em>, someone said.</p>
<p>autumn wind blows away last season&#39;s life<br>still luminous.</p>
<p>embrace what is to be<br>now that what was has gone.</p>
