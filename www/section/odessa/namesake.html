<p>tear down the fucking walls</p>
<p>rip out the doors.</p>
<p>throw wide your arms.</p>
<p>let the cold wind blow in.</p>
<p>wash away your sorrows.</p>
<p><em>sing in the time of joy</em>, someone said to me.</p>
<p>know when it&#39;s time to walk away.</p>
<p>don&#39;t mourn winter.</p>
<p>there&#39;s more to come.</p>
