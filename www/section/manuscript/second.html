<h3>On the second day the rains came.</h3><p>Smoking ruin. Compressed blast, screaming noise in an enclosed space. Blinking red. Heat, dripping gooey chunks of polymers. Filtered veiny bloodstained flash, to electroluminescence, to symbol, shape, conceptualization. Carbon and iron and oxygen. Essentials in all the wrong combinations.</p>
<p><code>... Warning ... Signal outside safe range ...</code></p>
<p>Flowing onward. The river to the stream. Glimmering surfaces reflected in scintillating fragments. Mesmerizing lucid dream, falling into warm deep water headfirst. Airless void of infinite embracing. Breathe, breathing, breathless. Glowing halos descending upon anointed heads of saints, silhouettes rehearsing familiar scenes. They dance in flowing clothes and sing in howling wordless words. Good and bad and love and fear become safe, menacing.</p>
<p><code>... Warning ... Low Power ... 4% ... 3% ...</code></p>
<p>Pressure, pushing, squeezing, creaking, crunching. Bone and metal driven past comfort, past tensile integrity. Viscosity becomes indistinguishable from solidity. Cracking cleavage, riven bergs floating in motes of vacuum. Medium rushing in to fill the spaces, spit and air and silence. Complex chains, sweet and aqueous. Silken, sugary.</p>
<p><code>... 2% ... 1% ... 0% ... Shutting Down ...</code></p>
<p>&quot;Here, swallow you down some water.&quot;</p>
<p>Remember the right way to swallow. Combinations of gestures, sore, rendered alien even in their familiarity. Change in focus. Planted swollen and bloody, face first in hot sand, creaking and shifting and cascading. Pain has yet to arrive, coming soon.</p>
<p>&quot;What just happened? What a fucking mess.&quot;</p>
